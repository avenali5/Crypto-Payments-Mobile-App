# Description
The project is a mobile app for Android and iOS that uses Bitnovo's test API, where you can create a payment request in USD, EUR or GBP and share it via link, email, WhatsApp, or QR code. This payment request can be paid with test cryptocurrencies following the link generated and once completed, the app displays a successful payment message in real time.
In order to get test crypto you can use any faucet of your choice, for example Google's https://cloud.google.com/application/web3/faucet/ethereum
